## git branching

git branching is a method to creater various branches to a project /
the master branch is where the main code is stored /
the feature branch is where we experiment new features to be implemented and then if they are what we want them to be /
we merge the feature branch with master branch /
we can also have a hot fix branch which can be used to patchup a bug in software
