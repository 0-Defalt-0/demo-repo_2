## git branching

git branching is a method to creater various branches to a project \
the master branch is where the main code is stored \
the feature branch is where we experiment new features to be implemented and then if they are what we want them to be \
we merge the feature branch with master branch \
we can also have a hot fix branch which can be used to patchup a bug in software
